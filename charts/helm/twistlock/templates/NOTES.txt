It may take a few minutes for the Twistlock Console UI to become available. You can watch its status by running:

  kubectl get svc -w twistlock-console -n twistlock

Once the console is available you can get the address of the Twistlock Console UI with the following commands:

   kubectl get svc twistlock-console -n twistlock

Once the service is up with an assigned external IP,
navigate to https://<external-ip>:8083 to create an admin account and install your license

Finally, you will need to install the Twistlock Defender daemonset on your cluster.
Just navigate to Manage/Defenders/Deploy/Defender Daemonset in the console UI and use "COPY" button
and then copy command to your cluster controller shell

To uninstall Twistlock console and Defender DS, simply type:

   kubectl delete ns twistlock
