It may take a few minutes for the Twistlock Console UI to become available. You can watch its status by running:

  kubectl get svc -w twistlock-console -n twistlock

Once the console is available you can get the address of the Twistlock Console UI with the following commands:

   kubectl get svc twistlock-console -w -n twistlock

and wait for external IP to be assigned, then ^C.

Once the service is up with an assigned external IP,
navigate to https://<external-ip>:8083 to create an admin account and install your license

Finally, you will need to install the Twistlock Defender daemonset on your cluster.
	$ ./install_defender_ds.sh <8083>

Refer to README.md file for uninstall notes
