## Deploy on GKE

If you have kubectl access to a GKE cluster, you can install the Twistlock Console Operator by using the steps 0-6 in the deploy_gke directory. Make sure you use steps 2a and 2b between step 2 and 3. You'll need to edit 2b to include your service account name that has cluster-admin privileges.
